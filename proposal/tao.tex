TAO extension throughput versus latency. With 60\% \texttt{object\_get}
and 40\%
\texttt{assoc\_range} operations, the TAO extension can reach 2.8 Mop/s before
saturating with an average latency of 30 \us. By using native
\texttt{get()}
operations for \texttt{object\_get}, the extension-based approach can outperform a
purely client-side implementation by 400 Kop/s.
