  \caption{Saturating throughput of the aggregation extension versus the
    amount of compute per aggregation. After aggregating two records, each
    operation raised the result to the power \texttt{n}, implemented as
    \texttt{n} 64-bit multiplications (hence the x-axis). Increasing the
    order (\texttt{n}) increases server-side compute in the
    extension-based implementation, hurting throughput. At an order of
    5000, the client-side approach is 2$\times$ faster.}
