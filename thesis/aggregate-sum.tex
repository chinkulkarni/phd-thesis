  \caption{Saturating throughput of aggregation versus the
    number of aggregated records. The extension-based implementation
    outperforms the client-side implementation irrespective of the
    number of records aggregated. The gains are highest when
    aggregations are over two records (2.4~M versus 1.5~M aggregations per second).}
