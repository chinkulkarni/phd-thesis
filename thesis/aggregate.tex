  \caption{Aggregation throughput versus latency. Aggregations
    combine four records. Under low
    load, the median latency of a client-side implementation is 1.6$\times$
    that of an extension-based implementation. Using an
    extension also improves saturating throughput from 1.2~M to 1.6~M
    aggregations per second.}
