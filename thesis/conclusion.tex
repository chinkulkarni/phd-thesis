\chapter{Conclusion}

Low-latency in-memory stores are designed to tolerate the heaviest request
loads. However, if they are too stripped down, they cannot deal with complex
higher-level operations such as load (re)distribution,
multi-tenancy, and expressive data models.

This thesis demonstrates that this trade-off is unnecessary.
It presents mechanisms for
reconfiguration, multi-tenancy, and expressive data
models that
would make these systems more practical and
efficient at cloud-scale while preserving their performance
benefits.
