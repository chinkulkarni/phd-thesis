\caption{Index scaling as a function of read throughput. Points represent
    the median over 5 runs, bars show standard error. Spreading the
    backing table across two servers increases total dispatch load and
    the \nnnth percentile access latency for a given throughput when compared
    to leaving it on a single server.}
