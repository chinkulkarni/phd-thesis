	\caption{Performance with a small fraction (15\%) of cooperative long
	running procedures that perform 128 \texttt{get}s. Yielding
	frequently can help improve median latency from 38~\us to
	22~\us. However, yielding
	too frequently hurts median latency. The storage server was
	offered a constant load of 1.1~Mops/s.}
