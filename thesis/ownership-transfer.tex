\caption{Ownership transfer. A view change is asynchronously propagated
  within a server, defining a cut across server threads. Then, the server
  extends this into a global cut covering all its connected client sessions.
  This defines a global view boundary among all operations while
  avoiding cross-core coordination both at servers \emph{and} clients.}
