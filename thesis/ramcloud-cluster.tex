\caption{The RAMCloud architecture. Clients issue remote operations
  to RAMCloud storage servers. Each
  server contains a master and a backup. The master component exports the DRAM of
  the server as a large key-value store. The backup accepts updates from other
  masters and records state on disk used for recovering crashed masters. A
  central coordinator manages the server pool and maps data to masters.}
