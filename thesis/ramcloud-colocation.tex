\caption{The throughput and CPU load impact of access locality. When
multigets
always fetch data from a single server (Spread~1), throughput is high, and
worker cores operate in parallel. When each multiget must fetch keys from
many machines (Spread~7), throughput suffers as each server becomes
bottlenecked on dispatching requests.}
