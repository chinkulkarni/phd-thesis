Rocksteady is a migration protocol for in-memory key-value stores that avoids
the need for and overhead of in-advance state partitioning; it eliminates
replication overhead from the migration fast-path; it exploits parallelism;
it exploits modern NIC hardware.  Rocksteady has a
``pay-as-you-go'' approach that helps avoid overloading the source during migration
using asynchronous batched on-demand pulls to shift load away from the source
as parallel background transfers proceed.  In all, Rocksteady can move the entire DRAM
of a modern data center machine in a few minutes while retaining \nnnth
percentile tail latency of lesser than 250~\us.
