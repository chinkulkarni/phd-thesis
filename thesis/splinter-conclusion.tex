\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In-memory storage can significantly accelerate
  data-intensive applications, including those that need fine-grained and
  real-time access to data.
However, as Dennard scaling ends, future cloud storage must not only be faster
  but also more efficient.
Splinter shows that soon legacy hardware isolation techniques will
  limit resource provisioning granularity in the cloud, but it also provides a
  way forward.
Systems must evolve to support granular, low-overhead shipping of compute to
    storage, and lightweight isolation between small compute tasks.
Splinter works toward that evolution by discarding hardware isolation in
  favor of static safety checks.
As a result, it supports thousands of tenants that can all access data in tens of
  microseconds while customizing storage operations to their needs and while
  performing millions of remote operations on modern multicore machines.
