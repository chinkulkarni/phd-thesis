  \caption{References during aggregation. All data accessed by the extension in
  Listing~\ref{lst:aggregate} is by reference whether that data is part of the
  arguments in the receive buffer or part of a record in the store. References
  work in reverse for the response; the extension passes references to data to
  the store, and the store copies that data into the response buffer.}
