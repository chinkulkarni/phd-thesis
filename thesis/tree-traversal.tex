\caption{Tree traversal using \texttt{get()} operations over a key-value
	store. Each step requires a lookup at the
	storage layer, which is latency-bound and expensive for deep traversals.
  If multitenant stores could be safely extended this function could avoid
  remote access stalls and request processing costs.}
