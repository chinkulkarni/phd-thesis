  \caption{Dispatch tasks on each core steal requests from the receive queue of
  the core to their right whenever they have no requests in their own
  receive queue. As a result, work from
  overloaded cores get redistributed without generating high contention. Here,
  core 1's in-progress tasks were induced by requests stolen from
  core 2's queue.}
