\caption{Comparison of YCSB-B performance using native and extension-based
	\texttt{get()} and \texttt{put()} operations at a tenant density
	of 1,024. When using extensions, the server saturates at
	4.3~million operations per second. In comparison, native
	operations are about 23\% more efficient, saturating at 5.3~million operations
	per second.}
